            <h1>What's New (2024)</h1>
            A lot has changed in the 2024 edition of Legendary Radio. In fact, it's almost completely different under the hood. But here's a brief overview of the changes that will be meaningful to most users.

            <h2>ONLINE MUSIC CATALOG SUPPORT</h2>
            <p>Our most-requested feature, previously thought to be impossible, is a reality! Searches will continue to bring up songs already in the database, but additional results sourced from the online Deezer catalog will appear as well. (Results are limited to 100 per search; this limit comes from the Deezer API, and while a workaround could probably be coded, results get spotty after 100 anyway -- best to just narrow the search instead. There is also a limit of 50 searches every 5 seconds, which probably shouldn't be a problem...)</p>
            <p>Why Deezer? Because the DJ software supports it. We also have access to another online catalog called IDJPool, which has lots of alternate mixes (and clean versions), but those are not easily searchable outside the software. (See "Ask the DJ" for more on that.)</p>
            <p>A note about this: like most music services, Deezer flags certain songs as "Explicit". Flagged songs can still be requested, but they will go through a manual approval process (see "Ask the DJ" below). There's a high chance these requests will be denied unless a clean version can be found, the song can be easily edited on the fly, or the song is known to be flagged incorrectly. As with uploaded songs, we want to maintain a friendly atmosphere for all attendees.</p>
            <p>Online songs which have already been added to the database (by the DJ) are indicated by a different font color. Request them while you can, because you never know when they might disappear from streaming!</p>

            <h2>"ASK THE DJ" FUNCTIONALITY</h2>
            <p>Still can't find what you need? Click "Ask the DJ" from the search bar and your search text will be added to a list of manual requests that the DJ can review (whenever they lose the next tournament round). This is a function of the VirtualDJ software designed to quickly determine if anything resembling the request exists in any available database.</p>
            <p>This functionality can even be accessed over the internet via the following URL:</p>

            <h2>IMPROVED CATEGORY FILTERS</h2>
            <p>Tired of trying to figure out if something would be considered part of a "Soundtrack", "Video Game Music", or "Video Game OSV"? Me too! You can now select as many category filters as you think might possibly apply to narrow down your options. Think of them less as different buckets to choose from and more like different "tags" a given song could have on it. (Or like the product filters on any given online store.)</p>

            <h2>RECENTLY RELEASED SONGS</h2>
            <p>Under the "NEW ARRIVALS" sidebar widget which still shows newly uploaded songs, you will now see a quick view of every song in the database that was released within the past 2 years. In other words, songs that probably haven't been played to death yet and could use another spin.</p>
